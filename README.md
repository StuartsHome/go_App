- Testing: Testify, Mockery
- Resty (Simple HTTP and REST client library)


// you need to download that module and record its version in your go.mod file. 
// The go mod tidy command adds missing module requirements for imported packages
// and removes requirements on modules that aren't used anymore.


### :wrench: To Do
- Docker app for REST server
- Database (MySQL)
- Testing (Testify, Mock)
    - Mock and stub REST server and http calls
